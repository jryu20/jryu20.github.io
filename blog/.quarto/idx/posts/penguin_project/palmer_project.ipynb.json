Determining the species of a penguin often requires a combination of biological expertise and many precise measurements, which can be difficult to obtain.\n\n>Because there are so many penguins, we can’t take many detailed measurements on all of them! In order to classify the species of penguins in large volume, we need to figure out *which* measurements are most important for distinguishing penguin species.\n\n>**In this post, our objective is to determine a small set of measurements that are highly predictive of a penguin’s species.** In particular, we will perform feature selection and then use a variety of machine learning models to determine the \"best\" set of three distinct measurements. \n\n<br>\n\n## 1. Data Import and Cleaning\n\n<br>\n\n## 2. Exploratory Analysis\n\n### Table 1: Summary Table\n\n### Figure 1\n\nFigure 1 explanation:\n\nFigure 1 is a scatterplot of flipper length (mm) vs body mass (g) of each penguin species on each island. We decided to plot these two quantitative variables because we noticed notable differences between variable means for each species (from the summary table).\n\nThere seems to be a positive correlation between flipper length and body mass, as well as correlation between penguin size and penguin species. The longer the flipper length the larger the body mass. Additionally, Chinstrap penguins may be slightly larger than Adelie penguins, but the most notable trend is that Gentoo penguins are by far the largest of the three species (Gentoo penguins have the largest flipper length and body mass).\n\n\n### Figure 2\n\nFigure 2 explanation: \n\nWe chose culmen length and depth as our variables because we wanted to see if a longer or deeper beak would serve as a predictor of the species of penguin. The results show that Adelie penguins tend to have shorter and deeper culmens, Gentoo penguins have longer but shallower culmens, and Chinstrap penguins have about equal length of culmens as Gentoos and about equal depth as Adelies.\n\n### Figure 3\n\nFigure 3 explanation: \n\nWe decided to use Delta 15 N (o/oo) as our quantitative feature in this figure because after looking at the table, there seems to be a clear distinction across different species. For example, under this category, the Gentoo penguins, by far, have the least amount of nitrogen isotopes in their blood, while the Chinstrap possess the most. Having a clear distinction across species would better inform our modeling because there is less room for error and the model can better predict based on less ambiguous decision regions.\n\n### Figure 4\n\nFigure 4 explanation:\n\nWe chose sex and penguin species because for the qualitative variable, we wanted to see if sex would be able to predict the type of species. The results show that there is virtually no difference in the levels of male and female penguins for all three species, which is most likely attributed to the fact that the scientists wanted to record equal numbers of each species, as to avoid any biases in the data. However, the graph does show us that Adelie penguins make up the majority of the penguins. Gentoo penguins have the second highest number of penguins, and Chinstrap penguins have the fewest.\n\n<br>\n\n## 3. Feature Selection\n\nThe CV scores indicate that models using the combinations of (Island, Culmen Length, and Culmen Depth), (Island, Culmen Length, and Delta 15 N), and (Island, Flipper Length, and Delta 13 C) are the best predictors of penguin species for the unseen test data. The culmen length and depth set scored remarkably high (0.985, with 1 being a perfect predictor of the data), which may be the product of overfitting, so more exploration is needed there. Culmen length and nitrogen levels in the bloodstream and flipper length and carbon levels in the bloodstream were also very high, clocking in CV scores of 0.966 and 0.962, respectively. These could also be attributed to overfitting, but the models below will better indicate whether or not that is the case. \n\nOverall, the CV scores for all of our combination permutations were pretty high, with the lowest score being 0.795. This suggests that the variables we selected are all generally good performers at predicting the species for the unseen data.\n\n<br>\n\n## 4. Modeling\n\n### Model 1 : K Nearest Neighbors\n\n#### 1. Cross validation to choose complexity parameters\n\n#### 2. Evaluation on unseen testing data\n\n#### 3. Visualization of decision regions\n\n#### 4. Discussion for K nearest neighbors\n\nOut of unseen testing data, the model incorrectly labels four Chinstrap penguins as Adelie penguins, and one Adelie penguin as a Chinstrap penguin. This is understandable as the decision regions plot for the island Dream shows the most inconsistencies between the fitted Knn model and the training data, and Dream only has Chinstrap and Adelie penguins. \n\nOn the Dream plot, the largest inconsistency is the 7 green data points (representing Chinstrap) in the region the fitted model marked blue (representing Adelie), which indicates the fitted model has a tendency to mislabel Chinstrap penguins as Adelie penguins. There are also a couple blue points in or on the border of the green region, which explains why the model may have mislabeled one Adelie penguin as Chinstrap. \n\n### Model 2 :  Random Forests\n\n#### 1. Cross validation to choose complexity parameters\n\n#### 2. Evaluation on unseen testing data\n\n#### 3. Visualization of decision regions\n\n#### 4.  Discussion for random forests\n\n Based on the decision regions above, only one of the data points seems to be in the wrong \"region\", yielding a high accuracy percentage of 95%. Due to the nature of random forests, the regions have more detailed boundaries (as opposed to just being a rectangular box), meaning that there are still going to be a couple of points that reside around these boundaries that the model will mislabel. For example, a blue data point in the island \"Dream\" plot that near the border of the two decision regions is found to be our mislabel according to our confusion matrix. Another mislabel can be found in the \"Biscoe\" plot with one of the red points that crosses the border into the blue region (this is the data point that was described at the beginning). Again, these mislabels occur because these points are located so close to the fine-tuned borders created by the random forests.\n\n### Model 3: Multinomial Logistic Regression\n\n#### 1. Cross validation to choose complexity parameters\n\n#### 2. Evaluation on unseen testing data\n\n#### 3. Visualization of decision regions\n\n#### 4.  Discussion for multinomial logistic regression\n\nThe model was able to predict the penguin species with extreme accuracy, only mislabeling one of the data points and scoring 0.984 on the test data. \n\nThe confusion matrix seems to indicate that the error happened on the second island (Dream), and looking at the decision regions on the second graph above we can see that the blue and green points (Adelie and Chinstrap penguins, respectively) are very close to each other. Comparing the blue points across all three decision region graphs, we can see that the Culmen Lengths and Depths for Adelie penguins are very similar to those of Chinstrap penguins, and they have some points of potential overlap. \n\nThis overlap is most likely what led the model to incorrectly label one of the Chinstrap points as Adelie. Chinstrap and Adelie penguins can have Culmen Lengths and Depths in the same ranges, so mislabeling only one of these points is still impressive. \n\n<br>\n\n## 5. Discussion\n\nOverall, all three of our models performed well, with scores of 0.983, 0.952, and 0.919 for multinomial logistic regression, random forests, and K nearest neighbors, respectively. The highest accuracy score was seen in the logistic regression model that used Island, Culmen Length, and Culmen Depth, so we recommend those as the ideal model and features for predicting penguin species. \n\nIncreasing the number of samples in the data would reduce the effect that outliers have on the data and lead to a more reliable prediction overall. It would also allow us to see if our logistic regression model really does predict species with a 98% accuracy rate and make sure that it was not due to a small sample size. \n\nMore data on Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins would also be helpful, since the majority of the current data set is Adelie penguins. They could also expand to more diverse islands, since Torgersen Island only housed Adelie penguins and not Gentoos or Chinstraps. \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"palmer_project.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"title-block-banner":true,"title":"Palmer Penguin Project","image":"gentoo.jpg","author":"Jeremy, Jun, Meichen","date":"2022-03-10","categories":["python","visualizations","project","ML"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
