## This Site

[Blog](blog.html) will showcase long-term projects, data-oriented tutorials, and experimentations with different programming languages.

[PSets](psets.html) will feature some of my favorite problems in mathematics and statistics as well as my solutions.

[Misc](misc.html) will contain anything that does not fall under the above two; it will mostly be a jumble of my spontaneous thoughts and things I find intriguing at the moment.
